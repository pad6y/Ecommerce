# Ecommerce
Basic Express Ecommerce site not using database or frontend templating engine or frameworks

Great learning experience building an express project not using any database or frontend technologies. Not ideal in the real usage 
but enjoyed seeing the disadvantages building projects this way and having more appreciation what frame works and libraries offer.
